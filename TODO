1. remember exit code somewhere (print it by echo $?)
	how to catch kill signal?


2. replace execvp() to execve()
	expand $PATH
	check if cmd is absolute of relative path
		check every (path+cmd) exists AND executable (using fstat st_mode)
		check current dir first!
	return 127(command not found) or 126(permission denied)


3. char *env_to_str(char *envname)
	expands $STR to string


4. Built-in commands
	echo with -n
	cd with absolute or relative path
	pwd
	export
	unset
	env
	exit
